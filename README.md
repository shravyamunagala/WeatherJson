# WeatherJson
This Weather app takes input from user which can be a zip code or name of the city.When he click submit it displays the weather condition.
I have used Yahoo weather API for this and the json format .I have used volly library which is included as dependecies in Gradle.
Just chnage the package name and import into android studio and start working!!
